# TradeReportGenerator
Core Java Project to generate data reports from incoming daily trade buy/sell instructions.
The main starting point of application is Runner.java.
In this class, you can replace the fileName variable with different sample CSV files.
In order to execute the main class, either one can pass one program argument like "inputFiles//tradeData_BUY_AND_SELL_200.csv" else the default file will be used to execute "inputFiles//tradeData_BUY_AND_SELL_200000.csv".

There are some sample input CSV files in the inputFiles folder.
There are also some sample output data report files which contain the printed report data report for reference with different set of trade detail instructions.
The sample output files was used for my testing needs and can be treated as a reference to understand the format in which the data report is printed on console.
